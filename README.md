# GitRepoOrganizer

## What is it?
It is an easy to read and convenient repository viewer for Github. It can also group repos. Read below to know more.

## Set up
1. Fork this repo to your Github account.
2. Open 'index.js' file and change the variable 'username' to your Github username.
3. Host a Github page of the repo.
4. Post the URL for the Github page in your [introduction README file](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).

## Grouping repos
1. For grouping, you need to follow a simple naming convention for your repos.  
All repos should be named in the manner - '{Group name}\_{Repo name}'  
For example, if you have 3 repos named 'Tree', 'Boosting', 'SVM' and you want to put them under a group named 'ML', then rename all 3 repos as 'ML_Tree', 'ML_Boosting', 'ML_SVM'.
2. If you don't put a group name or your name doesn't have an underscore, then the repo will automatically go into the 'Others' group.
3. Don't use multiple underscores in your repo names.
